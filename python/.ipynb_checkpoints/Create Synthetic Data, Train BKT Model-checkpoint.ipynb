    "To generate student data according to BKT assumptions, we start by deciding on the number of concepts that our synthetic student will learn from. In our running example, the students will answer questions on a single topic. Next, we set the true values for the parameters $P(L_0)$, $P(T)$, $P(G)$, and $P(S)$. Here, we choose $P(L_0) = 0.1$, $P(T) = 0.2$, $P(G) = 0.25$, and $P(S) = 0.1$. (If we were dealing with multiple concepts, we would choose a different set of values for each concept.) Finally, once we have the parameters, we generate student responses on a sequence of questions; in this example, 20 questions on a single topic.\n",
